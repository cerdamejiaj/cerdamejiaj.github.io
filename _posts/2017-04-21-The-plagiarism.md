TL;DR: The education system has failed to help students develop critical writing skills which lead them to commit plagiarism when they
reach college.

The underlying problem with students plagiarism does not only fall on what type of students they are or an individual's ethics. It also falls in the type of education they had
before they got to college. For students, high school is the stepping stone that will prepare them for college, but in some cases that is not true. According to [plagiarism.org](http://www.plagiarism.org/resources/facts-and-stats/), they conducted a survey of 24,000 students at 70 high schools and 58 percent admitted to plagiarism. Some might argue that
this high percent of students plagiarism has to do with the backgrounds of the students or their ethics. In the other hand, I argue that the education they received failed to prepare these students to develop critical thinking and writing skills, also informing them about the consequences of plagiarism.

In order to better prepare students when it comes to developing these crucial writing skills, our education system needs to implement a different English class structure. This structure should consist of intensive writing sessions; where teachers are helping students figure out different ways on how to write a different type of papers. Teachers can also use different books to help students to better analyze their writing. for example, BUGS in Writing, Revised Edition: A Guide to Debugging Your Prose. In this new English class structure, there should also be a session that goes over plagiarism. The topics of this session should include; what is plagiarism, why plagiarism is a crime and the consequences of plagiarizing.

The education system should start implementing the basic concept of this new structure starting in middle school. The reason why middle school would be a great start is because middle school is where students
start to develop some writing skills and also they start writing essays. Others may challenge this structure by insisting that middle school students are to young to handle such workload and they should be focusing in other things. I argue that starting at a early age has many benefits. Middle school students will start to develop writing skills that will help then do better in their English state tests. They will be better prepared when they get to high school where they will have to do a more intensive structure. After years of developing many writing skills and improving their writing, once students get to college they will have these skill that will help them throughout college and essentially they will not have to plagiarize when they have to write their papers.

With plagiarism being a problem that has been growing in high school and college. We have to look at the different roots that lead students to plagiarize. The education system being one of those main roots,
we have to change something about it. My solution is just the basics of a more bigger structure when it comes to changing English classes in middle school and high school. There are many other things that can
also be added to my solution, but there will also opposing sides to my solution as well. If we want to decrease the number of students who plagiarize, we must start in your education system and help students
become better writers and develop writing skills at an early age.
