  We all know about Google Gmail, we use it everyday for personal and professional purposes.  For the most part, we think that the emails we are receiving are save, secure and we shouldn't worry about opening any of them. This is the part were a lot of people are wrong. Not all of the emails that we are getting are safe or secure, this type of emails are called Spam emails. Gmail has done an amazing job separating our emails from primary, social and promotions, but they haven't done an amazing job from protecting us from spam emails. We get Spam emails everyday, some might go straight to the spam folder and others to our primary inbox. They might seem just like a regular email, but they are not.

   A lot of the Spam emails that we get are just for advertising but, others are harmful and can steal our personal information from our computers. There are various ways these emails can steal your personal information. One of the most common ways is called Phishing. Lets say you got an email from your "bank", saying that you have to login to your bank account to security reasons. The email also gives you a link where you have to
   go to login. You clicked on the link it takes you to a website that looks just like your bank's website. You enter you username and password and after that nothing happens. The persona behind the Spam email just easily got your bank account information by tricking you that it was your bank sending you that email and it was your bank's official website. Phishing is basically faking a website like facebook or even just a bank's website and when people enter their information, their information gets send to the person behind the Phishing.
