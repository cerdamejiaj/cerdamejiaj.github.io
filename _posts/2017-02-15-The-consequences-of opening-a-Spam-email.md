  We all know about Google Gmail, we use it everyday for personal and professional purposes.  For the most part, we think that the emails we are receiving are save, secure and we shouldn't
  worry about opening any of them. This is the part were a lot of people are wrong. Not all of the emails that we are getting are safe or secure, this type of emails are called Spam emails.
  Gmail has done an amazing job separating our emails from primary, social and promotions, but they haven't done an amazing job from protecting us from spam emails. We get spam emails everyday, some
  might go straight to the spam folder and others to our primary inbox. They might seem just like a regular email, but they are not.
