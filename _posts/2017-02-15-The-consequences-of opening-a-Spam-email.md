TL;DR: Mostly all email users know about spam emails, but not all know the consequences of opening them or the safety presages they
should follow to prevent spam emails from stealing their personal information.

We all know about Google Gmail, we use it every day for personal and professional purposes. For the most part, we think that the emails we are receiving are safe, secure and that we do not have worry about opening any of them. Unfortunately, many people are mistaken about this as some emails are not safe. One type of unsafe emails is spam emails. Gmail has done an amazing job separating our emails from primary, social and promotions, but they haven't done an amazing job from protecting us from spam emails. We get Spam emails every day, some might go straight to the spam folder and others to our primary inbox. They might seem just like a regular email, but they are not.

 A lot of the spam emails that we get are just for advertising but, others are harmful and can steal our personal information from our computers. There are various ways these emails can steal your personal information. One of the most common ways is called phishing. Let say you got an email from your "bank", saying that you have to log in to your bank account to security reasons. The email also gives you a link where you have to go to login. You clicked on the link it takes you to a website that looks just like your bank's website. You enter your username and password but after that, nothing happens. The person behind the spam email easily gained access to your bank account information by tricking you into thinking that they were your bank. Phishing is basically faking a website like facebook or even just a bank's website and when people enter their information, their information gets send to the person behind the phishing. Spam email used many clever methods to trick email users to open them and follow whatever is inside them.

 Another way of how spam emails can easily steal your information is by sending commercial emails. They advertise software programs that would "improve" your computer in many ways or something that would benefit you. These type of spam emails target people that have very little knowledge of computers and trick them into downloading programs. These programs are malicious that once install in your computer collects and record usernames and passwords. An example of this type of scam is myself, I once downloaded a program that I got from an email to clean my computer from junk files. The program didn't really improve my PC performance instead it made it slow. Days later Someone tried to login into my google account from Russia. I reset my computer and deleted all my files and programs and started with a fresh installation of windows. Not only you can get malicious programs on your computer but, you can also get a virus. Your computer can become infected with a virus and it can be used to send spam emails to your contact list in gmail and infect other people's computers.
