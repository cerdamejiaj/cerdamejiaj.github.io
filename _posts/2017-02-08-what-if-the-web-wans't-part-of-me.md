Ever since I first started using the internet when I was about eight years old, it become part of me. The question now is, what if the internet wasn't part of me? What type of person would a be now and how different would I be. When looking into my entire life, I pictured it without having access to the internet. The various outcomes of what type of person I would be and how different I would be, are limitless. Looking at my life now, I can say that I'm a sort of a geek and nerdy person. I spend most of my time on the computer playing video games and browsing the web or watching anime. I read about the latest technology news every day, and I like coding. I'm this type of person and like to do all these things because the internet has been part of me; otherwise, I don't think I would be this kind of guy.

If the Internet wasn't part of me, I think I would be more a trouble maker, a gang member, only caring about myself and I wouldn't even be in college. I'm from one of the most violence places in New York City; the South Bronx. I was surrounded by drugs, poverty, abuse, and shootings. If you didn't make it in school and made it to college, you would be just like the rest of the people in the streets. The internet was my escape route to success, knowledge, and motivation. The more I used it, the more I learned and wanted to be something in life. If the internet weren't there, I would probably be working at a fast food restaurant, making minimum wage and maybe would have a baby. This would be the best case scenario for me. The worse would be me being part of a gang, in the street selling drugs, living away from my family or even be in jail.  

Even though I didn't have any first-hand experience with the violence, the abuse, and drugs around my neighborhood and my family wasn't part of it. I think that because this environment surrounded me and if the internet weren't part of me, I would be consumed by this environment. The internet gave me the gateway to escape from all of these things, and I'm grateful for the person that I have become over the years.
