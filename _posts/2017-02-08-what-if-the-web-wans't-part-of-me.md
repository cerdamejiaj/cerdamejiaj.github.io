Ever since I first started using the internet when I was about eight years old, it become part of me. The question now is, what if the internet wasn't part of me? What type of person would a be now and how different would I be. When looking into my entire life, I pictured it without having access to the internet. The various outcomes of what type of person I would be and how different I would be, are limitless. Looking at my life now, I can say that I'm a sort of a geek and nerdy person. I spend most of my time on the computer playing video games and browsing the web or watching anime. I read about the latest technology news every day, and I like coding. I'm this type of person and like to do all these things because the internet has been part of me; otherwise, I don't think I would be this kind of guy.

If the Internet wasn't part of me, I think I would be more of a sports person. I would be more into sports like basketball, swimming, and baseball. I would have probably played any of these sports in high school and be good at it. My interests would most likely be going to the gym, spending my time outdoors, and watching tv.
