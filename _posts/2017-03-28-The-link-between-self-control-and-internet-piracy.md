TL;DR: For the most part, we all know what internet piracy is or digital piracy, but how can your self-control lead anyone to download or upload pirated content from the internet?


When I hear the words internet piracy, I immediately think of copyright infringement and downloading music, movies, and software for free that are meant to be purchased. But I don’t think of the kind of people that download or upload pirated content on the internet. During my research readings, one article became really interesting, Adolescent Self-Control and Music and Movie Piracy by Malin and Fowers. This article has a compelling theory which is that teens with low self-control are more likely to download pirated content from the internet. This theory was interesting for me because I’m someone that has downloaded pirated content from the internet and I have not evaluated myself to see if I have self-low control. My view on this theory is that I don’t think it suits everyone. For example, I think I have high self-control, I might choose to do things that are dangerous and have many consequences but also there are things that I would never do and can highly cost me. To test this theory I did an interview and asked series of questions some centered in internet piracy and others in research theory. During my interview, the interviewer was pretty familiar with internet privacy and had pirated things such as music, games, and movies. His first digital piracy download was music when he was in the seventh grade and he learned about downloading music for free by searching it up in google. He agreed that it was acceptable to download thing for free online even if they are pirated because sometimes people don't have the money to buy these things and also they are online for free. I was surprised by the answers he gave when I asked the research theory based questions. He agreed with the theory that teens with low self-control are more likely to download pirated content from the internet. He also rated himself a three for his self-control level which meant that he had low self-control. This interview gave me the chance to test this theory and I concluded that this theory was right, but at the same time, I want to interview a big number of people and see if I get the same results.
